    * Added the art and sound effects to go with this item.
      * Item Pickup Sound
      * Zombie death sound
      * Dead zombie graphic (more of a placeholder really)

      * Static graphic and in-level "floating" animation.
    * Added +1 and -1 animation effect when picking up or using the item.
